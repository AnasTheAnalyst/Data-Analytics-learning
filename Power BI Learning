-	MainTitle Measure = [Total Sales]
-	Subtitle Measure =   Format ([Total Sales], ‚Äú#,##0,,.0 M ‚Äù
We have to write another Change above subtitle measure to number format so we Change it and also add Difference
-	Subtitle Measure =   Format ([Total Sales], ‚Äú#,##0,,.0 M ‚Äù
  &‚Äù   ‚Äù& Format ([Total Sales vs forecast Pct difference], ‚Äú+0.0%; -0.0%‚Äù ) &  ‚Äú‚ñ≥ FC‚Äù

[Total Sales]  & Rept (UNICHAR(10), 2 )  & Rept (‚Äú    ‚Äù,25 ) &
&‚Äù   ‚Äù& Format ([Total Sales vs forecast Pct difference], ‚Äú+0.0%; -0.0%‚Äù ) &  ‚Äú  ‚ñ≥ FC   ‚Äù
IF ( [Total Sales vs forecast Pct difference] >=0 , ‚Äúüü¢‚Äù  , ‚Äúüî¥‚Äù )
